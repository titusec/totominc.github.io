<h3><a href="http://totominc.github.io/blackmarket"><u>Blackmarket</u></a></h3>
Another simple incremental-game, about selling drugs. You start with only a gun, and you have to build a drug empire to become trillionnaire. Blackmarket was my first really big project about in HTML/CSS/JS. It has been totally re-done : scripts and interface. Blackmarket has reach its official release, take a look now!<br>

<h3><a href="http://totominc.github.io/moneylife"><u>Money-Life</u></a></h3>
Money-Life is a simple <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/hyperhippogames/adventure-capitalist">Adventure Capitalist</a> clone, which was made to help me to learn Javascript. This game is pretty old and ugly.
